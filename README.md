# MTP-on-Survival-Analysis
This repository contains my work being done at IIT Bombay for M.Tech Thesis Project (MTP). Topic for my MTP is "Modern Deep Learning Methods for Survival Analysis".
I implemented various statistical techniques and deep learning models for survival analysis. Following methods have been implemented:

**Statistical Techniques**
1. Kaplan-Meier Model
2. Nelson-Aalen method
3. Log-Rank Test
4. Cox Proportional Hazard Model

**Deepm Learning Methods**
1. DeepHit Model
2. Dynamic DeepHit model
3. Transformer based model (experimentation are going on)
